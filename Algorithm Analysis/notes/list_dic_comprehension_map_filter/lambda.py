# python has support of so called annonymous or lamda function 
# its a way to write a function consisting of single stattement 
# Result of which is the return value 
# it is defined with lambda keyword , which has ne meaning other than , we dedine it as a funstion 
def short_func(s):
    return s*2
equi_lamds = lambda x:x*2
# it is specially convenient in data analysis bcoz,
# there are many cases where a data transformation function will take func as argument 
# less typing
